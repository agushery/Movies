## Clean Architecture with VIPER Pattern in Swift UI

A sample project demonstrating the implementation of Clean Architecture with VIPER Pattern in Swift UI. The project is designed to show how to build scalable and maintainable iOS applications.

## Tech Stack

Swift UI,
Realm Swift,
RxSwift,
SafariServices,
Dependency Injection,
VIPER

### VIPER Pattern

VIPER is an architecture pattern that stands for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. This pattern provides a clean separation of responsibilities in iOS applications and helps to achieve high modularity and testability.

### Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that focuses on separating the core business logic of an application from its technical details. It provides a scalable and maintainable structure for the codebase and helps to maintain the quality of the code over time.

### Benefits

Easy to understand and maintain the codebase
Separation of responsibilities between the different layers
Better testability and reduced coupling between components
Scalable and flexible structure for the codebase
This project is a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn about Clean Architecture and VIPER Pattern in Swift UI and how to implement it in real-world applications.
